This is the Corner Grocery project that is designed to sort through recent purchase data in order to prioritize the locations of high demand items.
I think the menu makes it easy for the user to navigate to the information they are looking for.
Overall the code could probably use a few tweaks to sort the data in different ways or display it in more informative graphics.
This program ended up being relatively short and simple, which makes it easy to read through and understand what it is doing and how it is doing it.
I found the skills developed while making this program to be transferable to my current job for use in sorting through and organizing inventory data within a facility.
